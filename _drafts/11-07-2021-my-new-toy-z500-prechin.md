Today came my new toy an brand new (Prechin Z500)[http://www.prechin.cn/a/jiaoxue/stm/210.html], it 
is an ARM STM32F1 Learning Board with more than 34 different peripherals. Out of box you have Network 
capability, six-axis accelerometer, MP3 chip, CAN, 485, 232, Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS and 2.4G support,
depending o the feature additional hardware is required, for example the GPS, Wifi and Bluetooth. 
It was released in 08/2020 and it was meant to be a step a head of the Z400 version.

Prechin is great company with a lot of learning boards, for each board they
provide a lot of documentation, with schematics, source code and examples in how to use each 
peripheral. They also do questionable things like providing cracked licensed software and keygen, but
they have a huge amount of documentation and everything just works out of the box.

The board is sent with a test firmware burned and the provided documentation contains its source code, I really
liked how they took care while writing the code it is really meant to be read by theirs users. The
firmware also gives us a idea of all the things we can learn with the board.

Now I must mention things I dislike about it:

First of all, everything is written in Mandarin and to be worse there is a lot of images with
mandarin text. Thanks God today we have Google Translator with image recognition, but anyway it is
really hard to read through it.

Second it is REALLY hard to get that documentation if you are not a Chinese living in China,
everything must be download from a Baidu Virtual Disk which only permits download for
registered users. The problem? You are only able to register if you have a Chinese phone
number. After you resolve this BIG issue another one arises, the speed of the download is
ridiculous slow. It took 3 weeks to download all the files from Baidu (of course it could be better
if I paid for a VIP account). 

Last one, the company does not give much attention to the official forum letting theirs users
without response, although they say in theirs website that they have dedicated lines for support
(obvious I was not able to test it living here in Sweden).

I really recommend this board for those adventurous who wants to learn or improve its skills in a
all-in-one board.

ps. If you want the documentation give me a comment asking for it I will upload for you.
