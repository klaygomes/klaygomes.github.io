My first programming language was JavaScript, which I learned by myself after I had finished
college in 2004. I had a lot of fun writing Greasemonkey scripts while improving the user experience
of popular sites at that time(hinewscrap was an example of a popular one).

In 2006, I started working with .NET; I had the opportunity to work with some big projects for the
government and private enterprises. Today I have been working primarily with React, Webpack, GO, C,
Node, Docker on Linux based systems.

After all, I consider myself a passionate Frontend Developer who loves to learn new things and work
with edge technologies.

### Hobby

I have a crush on embedded devices and development its development as a whole, so I spend a lot of
spare time playing with them. I have a particular passion for ARM Cortext M, in special
the STM32F103xx series. I like to play with them using Rust or C.
