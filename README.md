Estacouveflor is a playing joke with the phonetics of these words in Brazilian Portuguese, when it is spoken fast resembles "Stackoverflow", it explains the logo used :D

This is a personal blog where I write about things that I like. I have a crush on embedded devices and development its development as a whole, so I spend a lot of my spare time playing with them. I have a particular passion for ARM Cortex M, in special the STM32F103xx series. I like to play with them using Rust or C. So you probably will find a lot of about it there.

But I also know a lot about frontend technologies, good software patterns, and a few other things I'been working with for the last 12 years.
